## API Key Configuration

The website uses API keys for Google Maps, Google Analytics, and Uber integration. These are configured in `js/config.js`.

**For your own deployment:**

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials)
   - Create an API key
   - **IMPORTANT:** Restrict the key to your domain(s) under "HTTP referrers"
   - Enable only "Maps JavaScript API"

2. **Get a Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID:**
   - Create a GA4 property at [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Copy your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

3. **Update `js/config.js`:**
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_RESTRICTED_API_KEY',
       GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX',
       UBER_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_UBER_CLIENT_ID', // optional
       RSVP: {
           FORM_ACTION_URL: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL'
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Push your changes to your repository

   - See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions

**Note:** The API keys in this repository are examples. While they are safe to commit when properly restricted (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), you should replace them with your own keys for production use.
