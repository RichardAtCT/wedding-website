# Wedding Website
A beautiful, feature rich, device friendly wedding website.  
_See [wedding.rampatra.com](http://wedding.rampatra.com/) for a demo. Use invite code `271117` to RSVP._

# Highlights
1. Slick and fully __responsive__ design.
2. __RSVP feature__ which directly uploads data to a Google sheet.
3. __Receive email alerts__ when someone RSVPs.
4. __Add to Calendar__ feature which supports four different calendars.
5. __Book Uber__ button lets guests book a cab to the venue with just a single tap.
6. A nice __Youtube video__ showing your venue.
7. __Google Map__ showing your venue's location.
8. Start and run the website __completely free__. No hosting, backend server, or database required as you can use
   [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host and Google sheets (with the help of Google scripts) to store RSVP
   data.

# Getting Started

## Quick Start (Local Development)
1. `$ git clone https://github.com/rampatra/wedding-website.git` - clone this project to your computer
2. `$ cd wedding-website` - go inside the project directory
3. `$ npm install` - install dependencies
4. `$ npm run build` - compile sass to css, minify js, etc.
5. That's it, open `index.html` file on your browser by just double-clicking on it.

## API Key Configuration

The website uses API keys for Google Maps, Google Analytics, and Uber integration. These are configured in `js/config.js`.

**For your own deployment:**

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials)
   - Create an API key
   - **IMPORTANT:** Restrict the key to your domain(s) under "HTTP referrers"
   - Enable only "Maps JavaScript API"

2. **Get a Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID:**
   - Create a GA4 property at [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Copy your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

3. **Update `js/config.js`:**
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
       GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_RESTRICTED_API_KEY',
       GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX',
       UBER_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_UBER_CLIENT_ID', // optional
       RSVP: {
           FORM_ACTION_URL: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL'
       }
   };
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Push your changes to your repository
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions

**Note:** The API keys in this repository are examples. While they are safe to commit when properly restricted (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), you should replace them with your own keys for production use.
