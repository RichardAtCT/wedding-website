## API Key Configuration

The website uses API keys for Google Maps, Google Analytics, and Uber integration. These are configured in `js/config.js`.

**For your own deployment:**

1. **Get a Google Maps API Key:**
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials)
   - Create an API key
   - **IMPORTANT:** Restrict the key to your domain(s) under "HTTP referrers"
   - Enable only "Maps JavaScript API"

2. **Get a Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID:**
   - Create a GA4 property at [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
   - Copy your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)

3. **Update `js/config.js`:**

   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY: 'YOUR_RESTRICTED_API_KEY',
     GA4_MEASUREMENT_ID: 'G-XXXXXXXXXX',
     UBER_CLIENT_ID: 'YOUR_UBER_CLIENT_ID', // optional
     RSVP: {
       FORM_ACTION_URL: 'YOUR_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL',
     },
   };
   ```

4. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Push your changes to your repository
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
   - See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions

**Note:** The API keys in this repository are examples. While they are safe to commit when properly restricted (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)), you should replace them with your own keys for production use.

## Code Quality & Development Tools

This project includes modern development tools for maintaining code quality:

- **ESLint** - Lints JavaScript code and enforces best practices
- **Prettier** - Automatically formats code for consistency
- **Husky** - Git hooks that run linting before commits
- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD pipeline for testing and deployment

All code is automatically checked and formatted before commits. The CI/CD pipeline runs on every push and pull request.

## Browser Support

Modern browsers only (last 2 versions):

- ‚úÖ Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari
- ‚úÖ Mobile Safari (iOS), Chrome (Android)
- ‚ùå Internet Explorer (no longer supported)
